This suggests that the student expects the value of 'credit' from the local namespace of function 'combination' instead. However, since print(credit)is located at the outermost indentation level, 'credit' value of 16 from the global namespace is printed instead. To obtain the student's expected output of 0.3, the student should shift print(credit) to the line just after #3 at the same indentation level.
