The problem is decomposed by writing several other functions, described in the following parts.<br><br> For simplicity, the information given to you in this question is limited to the North South line and the East West line.

The dictionary has the MRT lines as its keys.

The function returns another dictionary which contains all the stations as its keys. The value for each key is a list of the MRT lines for that particular station. Note that if the station is an interchange, the list should contain all the lines calling at that station. <br><br>c) get_interchange(stationline): This function takes in a dictionary of stations and their lines (i.e. the output of part (b)). The function returns another dictionary which contains all the interchange stations as its keys. The value for each key is a list of the MRT lines for that particular interchange stations.<br><br>d) find_path(f, start, end): This function takes in three arguments: (1) the file object to a text file containing all the MRT lines and stations, (2) the startingstation, and (3) the endingstation. The function should return a list of stations starting from the starting station to the ending station with a maximum of one interchange.If there are more than one possible paths, the following considerations should be taken into account:<br><br>• If there is a path without changing MRT lines, the result should return this path.<br>• If the path must involve changing MRT lines, it will return the path with a minimum number of stations and containing only one interchange station.<br>• If no such path can be found as above, it will return None."

At present, there are eight coins in general circulation: <br><br>1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1, and £2<br><br>Note that the functiond compose(pence) can be implemented in a number of different ways, including by using brute force (i.e. exhaustive search). However, brute force implementations may only score a maximum of 12 points; the full 15 are only available for more elegant/efficient solutions."
